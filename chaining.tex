\chapter{Chaining Garbled Circuits}

In this chapter we introduce component-based garbled circuits.
Component-based garbled circuits allow for most of the work involved in building and communicating a garbled circuit to occur in an offline phase before the inputs or function to compute are known. 
This offers a significant improvement to the online performance of garbled circuits. 

We begin with the observation that most functions are composed of many smaller components. 
For example, many statistical functions are a composition of matrix and arithmetic operations.
The gist of component-based garbled circuits is then to build and communicate many garbled components in the offline stage. 
Then, in the online stage, the garbler and evaluator choose their inputs and a function a compute. 
The garbler communicates input labels and auxiliary information, to be discusses, to the evaluator, who stitches together the garbled components into the larger function.

The idea may make more sense with a real world example. 
Imagine that two banks integrate secure computation into their daily transactions.
At night when activity is low, the banks' servers exchange many garbled circuits, and then during the day, they use the pre-exchanged garbled circuits to quickly perform secure computation.
The computational requirements for the banks, when they compute the function, is only to exchange input labels and for the evaluator-bank to evaluate the garbled circuit, while, importantly, the banks preserve the ability to choose their inputs and the function to be computed at the time of the computation. 

\section{Chaining}


In this section we describe how to chain together garbled circuits.

Suppose that Alice and Bob are chaining two garbled circuits.
During an offline phase, Alice garbles many circuits and sends them Bob.
Later, during the online phase, Alice sends Bob input labels, some via oblivious transfer, and then Alice sends Bob \textit{link} labels.
A link label converts an output wire from one garbled circuit to an input wire of another garbled circuit.
Say that Alice and Bob want to set output wire $W_i$ of a garbled circuit to the input wire $W_j$ of another garbled circuit.
We suppose that Alice and Bob are using Free XOR, where each garbled circuit uses the same global $\Delta$.

We formally describe component-based garbled circuits as a tuple of three algorithms $(\Garble, \Link, \Eval)$.
The $\Garble$ algorithm is the same algorithm as before; it takes as inputs a circuit $\C$ and outputs a garbled circuit $\GC$. 
We extend the $\Garble$ algorithm to also take a component-circuit $c$ as input, instead of a complete circuit $\C$, which outputs a garbled component $\GC_c$, input wire set $e_c$ and output wire set $d_c$. 

The $\Link$ algorithm is new and designed for component-based garbled circuits. 
$\Link$ takes as input two garbled components $c_0 = (\GC_0, e_0, d_0)$ and $c_1 = (\GC_1, e_1, d_1)$, and a mapping of output wires of $c_0$ to input wires of $c_1$. 
$\Link$ outputs the \textit{link} labels needed to convert the output wires $c_0$ to input wires $e_1$. 
Suppose that output wire $W_i \in d_0$ has labels $(W_i^0, W_i^1)$, and input wire $W_j \in e_1$ has wire labels $(W_j^0, W_j^1)$.
To link $W_i$ to $W_j$, $\Link$ outputs $W_{ij} = W_i^0 \oplus W_j^1$. 
Since Free-XOR is being used, we have that $W_i^0 \oplus W_i^1 = W_j^0 \oplus W_j^1 = \Delta$ for some random value $\Delta$.
$W_{ij}$ is sufficient to transform a wire label of $W_i$ to a wire label of $W_j$ while preserving their semantic value. 
\al{Do we need more explanation of how chaining works here? I'm guessing another paragraph explaining how the Delta moves over}

The $\Eval$ algorithm is based on the original $\Eval$ algorithm used in normal garbled circuits, but with chaining added where needed.
The $\Eval$ algorithm takes as input a list of a garbled components and $\{c_i\}$, linking labels $\{W_{ij}\}$, and it outputs output labels $\{Y_i\}$. 
\al{Why does it not take input labels as input also}.
$\Eval$ starts with the inputs, and then proceeds component by component, evaluating each component in order to get the component output wire label.
Where necessary, $\Eval$ uses component output wire labels and link labels to compute the appropriate input label for later components. 
Once all components are evaluated, $\Eval$ recovers the garbled outputs $\{Y_i\}$ from the output components, and uses $d$ for that component to recover the real output $y$. 

Let us think about how the two banks who use secure computation in their daily operations employ the three algorithms.
At night, during the offline stage, the garbler-bank generates many circuit components, garbles them with $\Garble$, and sends the garbled circuits to the other evaluator-bank. 
The garbler-bank and evaluator-bank also perform the offline phase of OT-preprocessing.
During the day, when the banks decide that they need to compute some function $f$, they check that they have sufficient components to compute $f$. 
If they do, the garbler-bank runs $\Link$ on the components used in $f$, and sends the output link-labels to the evaluator. 
The garbler and evaluator also exchange wire labels, some via online OT-preprocessing. 
Now that the garbler has the garbled components, link labels and input labels, they run $\Eval$, recovering the output of the function.
\al{change output to Z, instead of y --- y is bob's input}

\section{Security of Chaining}

In this section, we show how to adapt the standard definition of privacy, presented in chapter 2, to component-based garbled circuits.
Recall from Chapter 2 that we said a garbled circuit scheme is secure if for all probabilistic, polynomial-time simulators (i.e algorithms) $S_1$ and $S_2$ the following holds:
\begin{equation}
    \{(S_1(x, f_1(x,y), f(x,y)))\}_{x,y} \compindist \{(\viewrv^{\Pi}_1(x,y), \outputrv^{\Pi}(x,y)) \}_{x,y}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \{(S_2(x, f_2(x,y), f(x,y)))\}_{x,y} \compindist \{(\viewrv^{\Pi}_2(x,y), \outputrv^{\Pi}(x,y)) \}_{x,y}
\end{equation}

To consider the security of component-based garbled circuits, we add in the extra information that each party receives into $\viewrv^{\Pi}(x,y)$. 
First, consider the party 1, the garbler. 
The garbler only receives additional information from OT-preprocessing, which we know to be secure. 
So the garbler-side is secure in component-based garbled circuits.

Second, consider party 2, the evaluator. 
The evaluator receives the following information: pre-garbled components $\{GC_i\}$, input labels $\{W_j^{x_j}\}_{j \in \Inputs(C)}$, output map $d_{C_out}$ and link labels $\{W_{ij}\}_{i,j \in \Components}$.
The pre-garbled components, output map and input labels do not reveal any information for the same reasons that they are fine in the standard definition of security.
The wire labels are the xor of two random values, hence they themselves do not reveal any semantic information about the value of a wire. 
Moreover, the link labels cannot be used in conjunction with any wire labels to gain any further information.

It should be noted that this not even close to a formal proof of security of component-based garbled circuits. 
A formal proof is long, and beyond the scope of this project; rather, this section highlights the intuition behind why we believe a formal proof of security to be possible. 

\section{Single Communication Multiple Connections}
\textit{Single Communication Multiple Connections} (SCMC) is a method of reducing the number of linking values that Alice and Bob exchange.
In the naive chaining scheme, online bandwidth scales linearly with the number of wires being chained, since a ciphertext is communicated per wire being chained.
For some cases, this is a lot of communication.
If Alice and Bob are chaining two garbled circuits that perform matrix multiplication on $100$ by $100$ matrices with entries that are 16 bits, then Alice sends $8,000$ ciphertexts to Bob - $8,000$ ciphertexts is 4 kBs.
SCMC reduces the chaining operation to require a single ciphertext of communication: an $8,000$x improvement.

SCMC works like most garbled circuits improvements: cleverly choosing wire labels.
The key observation is that consecutive output wires are often chained to consecutive input wires.
Suppose we are chaining garbled circuit $\C_0$ with output wires $\{W_i\}_{i \in \SFOutputs(\C_0})$ to garbled circuit $\C_1$ with input wires $\{Y_i\}_{i \in \SFOutputs(\C_1)}$.
Moreover, for all wires $W_i$ being chained in $\C_0$, $W_i$ is being chained to $Y_j$ where $i = j$; intuitively, a wire in $\C_0$ is being chained to its corresponding wire in $\C_1$.
\al{What does this mean? What is a corrresponding wire?}
Alice, when garbling, sets all output wires $W_i$ to $W_0 \oplus H(T \oplus (i || b))$, and all output wires $Y_i$ to $Y_0 \oplus H(T \oplus (i || b))$ where $H$ is a hash function.

\section{Security of SCMC}
SCMC is known to be secure in the random oracle model.
In the random oracle model, we assume that $H$ is a random function.
That is, on any input $x \in \{0,1\}^*$, $H$ outputs a uniform random bit-string of length $\lambda$.
