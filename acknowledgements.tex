\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
%I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Adam Groce. 
%He has been a great advisor and mentor over the last few years. 
%I would also like to thank my collaborators Alex Malozemoff and Arkady Yerukhimovich
%
%I would like to thank all of my friends; it seems like it's been a lot longer than four runs, but it was a good run. 
%Of all my friends, I would like to especially thank Cat. 
%Cat you have been an amazing companion throughout my time at Reed, and I'm sure at times that I didn't express nearly as much gratitude as I felt. 
%I wouldn't have been able to do Reed with you. 
%
%Finally, I would like to thank my parents and brother.
%You guys mean so much to me; I should probably call you more.
