\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Adam Groce. 
He has been a great advisor and mentor over the last few years.
I would also like to thank my collaborators Alex Malozemoff and Arkady Yerukhimovich; thank you for letting me contribute to your project - it was a pleasure.

Thank you to all of my professors at Reed. 
I learned so much from all you, and I appreciate the work that you put into my education.

Thank you to all of my friends; it seems like it's been a lot longer than four years.
So much has happened and changed, and I will forever cherish the memories.

Of all my friends, I would like to especially thank Cat. 
Cat, you have been an amazing companion throughout my time at Reed, and I'm sure at times that I didn't express nearly as much gratitude as I felt. 
I wouldn't have been able to \textit{do} Reed without you. 

Finally, I would like to thank my parents and brother.
You guys mean so much to me; I should probably call you more.
