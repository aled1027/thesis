\chapter{Implementation}

This section discusses the bulk of my thesis work: implementing chaining and SCMC, and testing their performance.
My implementation is called \CompGC is written in C.

\section{\LibGarble}
\al{fix} \CompGC is written on top of \LibGarble.
\LibGarble is a C library that is a fork of \JustGarble.
\JustGarble was produced by BHR in 2012.
All it does is create circuits, garble them, and evaluate them in very fast speeds.
\LibGarble is a rework of \JustGarble in which the memory layout and other things are changed to speed up computation.

\section{Our Implementation: \CompGC}
\CompGC implements the theoretical ideas of naive chaining and SCMC.
