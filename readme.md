# Thesis
My senior thesis on multiparty computation (a problem in cryptography). For more info, read the thesis or see my description of the project on my website: [aled1027.github.io](aled1027.github.io).


## TODO
- OT citations
- table numbering
- W_i^* in table of notation

## Not doing
- expand OT improvements section

## Done
* \samples from notation
    * figure out fix
    * use macro
    * what about \leftharpoonup
* citations on history
* new section in comp based garbled circuits talking about previous work
    * include citations from compgc paper
* list of abbreviations
* fix original OT section - use figure from talk
    * finish chapter better
* intro revisions
    * project vs my work
    * describe component-basd garbled circuits as a project that I worked on collabors, not a preexisting idea.
    * removing skipping around this thesis sentence
    * start with example at beginning of intro
        * then say this example is a special case of secure computation
        * by generalizing to an arbitrary function, we open many possiblities: elections, elections with no centralized body, etc. 
* conclusion rewrite
    * brief, high level summary
    * problem:
    * our solution
        * components
        * scmc
        * compgc
    * why its valuable and good
    * future 
        * compgc is a proof of concept of sorts
             * should turn into something bigger
        * malicious
        * multiparty mpc
    * goals:
        * "what we did from less tech minded people"
        * what I want people to take away

## Conventions
- `W_i^j`
- `W_i^*`
- `\sigma_i` = semantic value of wire `W_i`
- `\gets`
- whatever I end up using for randomly samples

- Inputs x and y and output z
